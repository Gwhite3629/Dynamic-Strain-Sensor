Concepts:
    Hysteresis:
        Measurements are taken at a fixed rate.
        When a measurement goes above the threshold
        the sample rate increases. As long as the measurements
        remain above the threshold they will continue at this rate.
        When the measurements go below the threshold there will be a
        continued time of increased sampling. If the measurement goes back
        above the threshold then the timer will reset. If the timer runs out
        then the sample rate will be lowered.
    Time stamps:
        Time stamps are relative to the beginning of program
        execution. Time is in format of Days-Minutes-Seconds
        and the calendar date of program execution is recorded.
    Measurements:
        Measurements are taken on intervals.
            *Initial-temperature
            *Dynamic-Strain-Magnitude
            *Dynamic-Strain-Frequency
            *Final-temperature
        Measurements are recorded in CSV format with a header.
        Measurement headers are in the following format,
        <Start Time>
        <Measurement Time><Intitial Temp><Magnitude><Frequency><Final Temp>
        
        Header Example:
            Start Time 1-3-2022-11-32-45
            Time | ITemp | Mag | Freq | FTemp

        Measurement data is recorded in the following format,
        <Integer><Float><Sci><Sci><Float>

        Data Example:
            0  | 30   | 1.0e-3 | 2.0e2  | 30.5
            5  | 31   | 1.1e-2 | 2.01e2 | 31.2
            10 | 31.4 | 2.0e-2 | 2.0e2  | 31.3
